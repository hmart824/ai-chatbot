Summer in India:

Summer in India typically spans from March to June. It is characterized by hot and dry weather across most parts of the country. Temperatures often soar, especially in the northern and central regions, frequently exceeding 40°C (104°F). The southern parts, particularly coastal regions, experience relatively milder temperatures due to the moderating influence of the sea.

Summer is a challenging season marked by heatwaves and water scarcity in many areas. It also brings relief to some regions with the arrival of tropical fruits like mangoes, lychees, and watermelons. Despite the harsh conditions, summer is a time for various cultural festivals and celebrations across the country.

Agriculture during the summer season heavily relies on irrigation, with crops such as wheat, barley, pulses, and some vegetables cultivated during this time. Summer vacations for schools and colleges are also a significant feature of this season, allowing families to escape to cooler hill stations or beaches.

Monsoon in India:

The monsoon season typically lasts from June to September. It is characterized by the arrival of the southwest monsoon winds, which bring heavy rainfall to most parts of the country. The onset of the monsoon varies across different regions of India, starting from late May in the southern state of Kerala and progressing northwards.

Monsoon rains are crucial for agriculture, replenishing water sources and supporting the growth of crops. Major kharif (monsoon) crops such as rice, maize, millets, and cotton are sown during this season and harvested later in the year. The monsoon season is also associated with lush green landscapes, rejuvenated rivers, and cultural festivities like Teej and Raksha Bandhan.

While the monsoon is essential for agriculture, it also brings challenges such as flooding, landslides, and waterlogging in urban areas. Nevertheless, it plays a vital role in India's economy and ecosystem, impacting livelihoods, water resources, and biodiversity.

Autumn or Post-monsoon in India:

Autumn, spanning from October to November, is a transitional phase marked by decreasing rainfall and relatively cooler temperatures. The weather becomes more pleasant, with clear skies and moderate temperatures, making it a favorable time for outdoor activities and tourism.

Agriculture during autumn includes the harvesting of kharif crops like rice, pulses, and oilseeds, as well as the sowing of rabi (winter) crops such as wheat, barley, and mustard. The season is also associated with cultural events and festivals like Diwali, Durga Puja, and Navratri, which are celebrated with fervor across the country.

Autumn showcases the vibrant colors of nature as leaves change hues, and fields are ready for harvesting. It is a time of transition and renewal, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and the agricultural cycle.
